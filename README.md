# GalleryImages
This app can show images on the screen. I've created it based on the clean architecture and MVVM-C pattern.
<br>
the flow application handles by coordinator pattern.

<p>
  At the first, App runs and fetch data from the service. after that All data can cache on the mongodb. I use realm-MongoDB for caching data.
